# Femur

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/recordsonribs/femur.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/recordsonribs/femur)

Femur is a quick and (relatively) dirty Python script for uploading our releases to the various places they have to go on release.

This was built entirely with our own needs in mind - your milage may vary.

##Â Usage

`femur <directory you want to upload>`

## Tests

Using `pytest`, run as usual.

## Todo

- Checks and balances for the files before they are uploaded.
- Add to the MySQL database automatically.
- Upload to n arbitary locations.
